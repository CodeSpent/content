# **Content Repository**

This repository is dedicated to managing all types of content in an organized and version-controlled manner. It is designed to operate independently, enabling seamless integration with other services (like APIs and frontends) as a **Git submodule** within the `phanford.dev` ecosystem.

---

## **Repository Purpose**

The purpose of this repository is to:
1. Centralize all content such as **articles**, **notes**, **documents**, and **papers**.
2. Maintain clear organization of Markdown files and associated metadata (like frontmatter).
3. Work seamlessly as a **submodule** within the `phanford.dev` project to allow real-time updates and easy deployment.
4. Enable scalable workflows including content creation, version control, and automated publishing.

## **How the Content Repository Works**

### **As a Submodule in `phanford.dev`**

This repository is integrated into the core `phanford.dev` project as a **Git Submodule**, allowing it to exist separately yet still function as an integral part of the ecosystem.

1. **Adding as a Submodule**:  
   In your `phanford.dev` repository, this repository is initialized as a submodule (usually under `content-repository`):
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/user/phanford-content-repository content-repository
   ```

2. **Cloning a Project with a Submodule**:  
   When cloning `phanford.dev`, you need to initialize this submodule:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/phanford.dev
   cd phanford.dev
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```

3. **Updating Submodule Changes**:  
   If changes are made to the content repository and pushed independently, your `phanford.dev` will need to fetch and update:
   ```bash
   cd content-repository
   git pull origin main
   ```

4. **Committing Changes to Submodule**:  
   If you make changes to the `content-repository` from within `phanford.dev`, donâ€™t forget to commit those changes in the parent repository:
   ```bash
   git add content-repository
   git commit -m "Updated content repository"
   git push origin main
   ```

## **Core Content Types**

This repository organizes its content into categories for flexibility and scalability. Each content type serves a specific purpose, outlined below:

### **1. Articles**

Articles are long-form pieces of content intended for blog posts, editorials, or other polished publications. These are examples:

- Tutorials
- Industry insights
- Public-facing documentation

**Structure**:
- Stored within the `articles/` directory.
- Written using Markdown with frontmatter for metadata.

**Example Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
title: "Introduction to React"
author: "John Doe"
tags: ["React", "JavaScript"]
date: "2023-10-10"
draft: false
---
```

**Use Case**: Blog posts, technical write-ups, or marketing content.

---

### **2. Documents**

Documents represent formal yet more general-purpose content compared to articles. They could include quick-start guides and internal documentation or serve as reference pieces.

**Structure**:
- Stored within the `documents/` directory.

**Example Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
title: "Internal Workflow Documentation"
author: "Jane Smith"
version: 1.2
tags: ["workflow", "internal"]
date: "2023-10-15"
---
```

**Use Case**: Functional guides, onboarding materials, and procedural documents.

---

### **3. Notes**

Notes are shorter, less formal, and often represent snippets of ideas, thoughts, or knowledge. These are ideal for quick publishing from external tools like Obsidian.

**Structure**:
- Stored within the `notes/` directory.
- Typically, notes follow the format you might find in Obsidian or another note-taking tool.

**Example Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
title: "Personal Productivity Tips"
tags: ["productivity", "life"]
date: "2023-10-12"
---
```

**Use Case**: Sharing small, concise pieces of information or actionable ideas.

---

### **4. Papers**

Papers are formal, research-heavy documents such as white papers, research findings, or thought-leadership pieces. These require careful formatting and metadata for authenticity and reference.

**Structure**:
- Stored within the `papers/` directory.
- Papers may include additional references and attachments (e.g., Latex files, PDFs).

**Example Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
title: "Deep Dive into Machine Learning"
authors: 
  - "Alice Brown"
  - "Bob Green"
publication: "Phanford Research Lab"
tags: ["machine learning", "research"]
date: "2023-09-01"
references:
  - "https://arxiv.org/abs/1234.56789"
---
```

**Use Case**: White papers, formal research, and influential thought-leadership material.

---

## **File and Metadata Standards**

All files in this repository are Markdown-based and structured with **YAML frontmatter** for metadata. This makes content parsing seamless, whether for publishing or processing by APIs.

**Example Markdown Content File**:
```markdown
---
title: "How to Build Faster Websites"
author: "Jane Smith"
tags: ["Web Development", "Performance"]
date: "2023-08-01"
type: "article"
summary: "Learn how to optimize your site for performance, from caching to code splitting."

## **How to Add Content**

1. Add your content to the appropriate folder (`articles/`, `notes/`, etc.).
2. Use **frontmatter metadata** to define key attributes (e.g., title, tags, date).
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new article: 'How to Build Faster Websites'"
   git push origin main
   ```

If this repository is a submodule inside `phanford.dev`, follow the submodule instructions outlined earlier.

---

## **Future Plans**

1. **Versioning**: Introduce version control for content types, particularly `documents` and `papers`.
2. **Preview Workflow**: Enable previewing drafts before publishing via `phanford.dev`.
3. **Improved Automation**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to validate content and populate the API automatically.
4. **Expanded Types**: Add more content types (e.g., tutorials, case studies).
