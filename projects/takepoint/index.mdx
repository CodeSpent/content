## About TakePoint

TakePoint is a comprehensive sprint planning platform designed with distributed teams in mind that aims to reduce oversights in sprint planning. Taking a flow-first approach from the perspective
of developers running Story Pointing and Retrospective sessions for distributed teams, TakePoint helps teams collaborate on the planning aspects more effectively.

### Why TakePoint?

I started TakePoint in the winter of 2025 after observing how distributed teams struggle to collaborate effectively on the parts of sprint planning left up to the engineering teams. In larger teams,
oversights in planning can lead to delays and unintended consequences; costing the team time, money, and frustration. Creating a collaborative experience that enables every dev to participate
in a low-pressure and interactive environment, TakePoint aims to reduce oversights and incentivize authentic team participation.

**TakePoint** isn't exactly my first SaaS, but it is the first SaaS I built with a clear vision and a clear target; To help distributed teams plan their work more effectively and collaboratively. I've
worked on teams absolutely full of talented engineers with unique perspectives and experience levels in their respective niche areas. Somehow we'd always seem to miss the mark on planning, and
I began to recognize that there was a gap in participation. For the most part, we'd find ourselves in silos working from spec, which isn't an uncommon scenario for remote teams.

Since I started as a developer, I've always had a pretty good eye for process and augmentation. I started my career as a NOC analyst at Dick's Sporting Goods identifying problems in our process and
taught myself to code to solve those problems. That mentality has never changed. **TakePoint** is a great example of how I leverage my practical experience, exposure to AI, perspectives for business value,
and eye for developer-experience to create process that creates tangible value for teams.


### What I Learned Building TakePoint

#### Building a SaaS Product
As I've said, **TakePoint** isn't exactly my first SaaS. I've built a lot of projects in my career, but none have truly seen the light of day. It is immensely challenging to wear enough hats to have rigorous
standards but also put out a product that actually achieves the expected business value. I learned a lot about trade-offs, business intelligence, and how to refrain from the trap I've fallen into time and time
again -- **building a product for me instead of my users**.

I'll be honest, I don't actually have a lot of expectation from **TakePoint**. If it were to fail tomorrow, I'd walk away knowing that I took everything I possibly could from it within the scope of my
capabilities. There's so much more to learn when it comes to building a SaaS product alone, and I'm excited to continue to learn the soft skills necessary to see a product to fruition, but the perspectives and
experience I've gained from building **TakePoint** will be invaluable to me in the future.

#### Real-Time Collaboration
Real-time features are a huge part of building collaborative tools, and I don't think we often give consideration to how much can go wrong when building for these features. I've fought them all; race conditions, duplicate
events, deadlocks, and some minor hair-pulling. This was immensely valuable experience. Very seldom in my career have I been faced with a challenge that genuinely felt like playing Jenga. Every change introduced a new side effect.
This wasn't an implementation I could just wing, it required me to develop a deep understanding of the architecture behind these features and design each component with each other in mind. This is a niche area I feel game developers
naturally excel at, with the entire paradigm of multiplayer games being built around real-time communication. Given this, I took a unique approach by learning from game developers and even building my own Texas Hold'em engine to test my assumptions.

This was a very interesting way to learn about building real-time communication systems, but somehow I found that when I started designing these features for **TakePoint**, I was suddenly so lucid in my vision for what was neccessary. Low and behold,
my first attempt ...failed. Very badly, it was catastrophic. What I did have, however, was a much better understanding of the mechanisms which enabled me to take that catastrophe and in just a few iterations have a near bullet-proof real-time system in place.
This approach to learning through game developers was a massive hail mary that didn't seem to be going anywhere, but I quickly found the value in the perspective and executed on it in a way that makes me very proud.
