## About TakePoint

TakePoint is a comprehensive sprint planning platform designed with distributed teams in mind that aims to reduce oversights in sprint planning. Taking a flow-first approach from the perspective
of developers running Story Pointing and Retrospective sessions for distributed teams, TakePoint helps teams collaborate on the planning aspects more effectively.

### Why TakePoint?

I started TakePoint in the winter of 2025 after observing how distributed teams struggle to collaborate effectively on the parts of sprint planning left up to the engineering teams. In larger teams,
oversights in planning can lead to delays and unintended consequences; costing the team time, money, and frustration. Creating a collaborative experience that enables every dev to participate
in a low-pressure and interactive environment, TakePoint aims to reduce oversights and incentivize authentic team participation.
