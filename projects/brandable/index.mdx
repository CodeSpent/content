## About Brandable
Brandable is a tool for checking brandability across social platforms, sentimental analysis, and domain availability of a particular name to determine
if it can make for a functional brand. I began this project in ~2018 when I was first learning React, but saw a need for it especially within the vibe-coding
community for rapidly brainstorming names.

I began rebuilding it in January of 2025 and have since added a plethora of features from sentiment analysis, wordmark alignment suggestions, and AI
insights powered by Claude-s OPUS.
