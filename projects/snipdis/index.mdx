## Overview
**SnipDis** is a Discord bot and extension ecosystem for sharing articles, videos, and websites in Discord forum channels. It offers a clean and consistent interface to make sharing information more stream-lined.

### Why SnipDis?
I built **SnipDis** as I run a Discord server for software engineers, politics, economics, music, arts, and more. The idea behind this server can be reduced to **we love learning and we love teaching**. It's a place where
everyone shares the same mission of just striving to be better at what they do and enable those around them to get started and do the same.

Two of the biggest issues we have are consistency in content formatting and the friction that comes with sharing information found. I know it can sound ridiculous, but copying a link, writing a title, pasting it in the message, pressing enter
to force the meta content to register, and then compose a contextual message around it can be a really painful experience (especially if you're doing this 20 times a day).

**SnipDis** aims to solve this problem by turning this process into a single browser extension click or a single *slash command* in Discord.
